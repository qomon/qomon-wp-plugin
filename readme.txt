Easily insert your Qomon Form in your site. 

== Description ==

Qomon is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that assists organizations by offering a range of features designed to enhance their operations. 

The Qomon plugin, for instance, provides a service that allows Qomon users to seamlessly integrate a form created within the qomon.app application onto their WordPress site. 

To access this functionality, having a Qomon account and having previously designed a form are prerequisites. To effectively utilize the Qomon plugin's capabilities for displaying forms, it's essential to obtain a unique form_id generated exclusively by Qomon. This form_id serves as a crucial identifier that enables the plugin to retrieve and present the designated form on your WordPress site. This mechanism ensures a seamless integration between the qomon.app application and the plugin, allowing for the effortless display of your chosen form.

This plugin leverages a script developed by Qomon, enabling the generation of an embedded form directly within the webpage.

### INTEGRATIONS

Then to add a Qomon form to your page you have 2 options:

#### I. Adding through the Qomon Form Block
Once activated you will be able to add a form to your page using a Qomon Form Block.
